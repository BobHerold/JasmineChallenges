Drink About Challenge from the Code Institute.

Your challenge is to write some tests for the Drink About game.

Drink About is a simple function that will check the age and return a drink appropriate for your age. Create a function called whatCanIDrink. This function should take in age as parameter. The function should do the following:

If the age is less than 0, then it should return "Sorry. I can’t tell what drink because that age is incorrect!"
If the age is less than 14, then it should return "Drink Toddy"
If the age is less than 18, then it should return "Drink Coke"
If the age is less than 21, then it should return "Drink Beer"
If the age is less than 130, then it should return "Drink Whisky"
Else return "Sorry. I can’t tell what drink because that age is incorrect!"

Welcome Bob Herold,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project.

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the backend lessons.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here are the updates since the original video was made:

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

--------

Happy coding!
